                    Project "Helios" is a gravity simulation using Newton's universal law of gravitation and Kepler's
                    1st law of planetary motion to simulate the movements of objects in space under the influence of
                    gravity. This simulation is used to model the behavior of celestial bodies, such as planets, moons,
                    satellites, and comets.

                    As an anime and manga lover, it can be difficult to keep track of all the different series you are
                    watching or reading, especially if you are following multiple series at once. This is where a list
                    application can come in handy.<br><br>
                    Built using HTML, CSS and Electron JS, this tracker allows users to keep track of the series they
                    are watching or reading, including the episode or chapter they are on, their progress through the
                    series, and any ratings they wish to add. Users could also search for new series to add to their
                    list and view information about each series.

                <p>
                    Project "Politismos" is a trading game demo that allows players to trade goods across procedurally
                    generated islands. Importantly, the game world is generated procedurally, meaning that the landscape
                    and islands are randomly generated by an algorithm rather than being pre-designed by developers.
                    <br><br>
                    The player must carefully manage their inventory and finances to maximize their profits. As the
                    player becomes more successful, they can invest in their trading company, expanding their fleet of
                    traders across the island.

                    the player's goal is to prevent it from doing so. <br><br>
                    The game was well received and won 61st out of 2939 participants in the "Theme" category. It's
                    unique concept and fast-paced gameplay made it a popular choice among participants and judges alike.
